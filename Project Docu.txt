1. Project Overview
1.1 Project Description
A web application that streamlines pet adoption by connecting animal shelters with potential adopters. The system allows shelter administrators to manage pets, track veterinary records, and process adoption applications. Adopters can browse available pets, submit applications, and track their status. The platform replaces traditional paper-based processes with a digital solution that improves efficiency and transparency.
1.2 Target Users
1. Shelter Administrators: Manage pet inventories, medical records, adoption applications, and multiple shelters. Require admin privileges and data management tools.

2. Pet Adopters: Browse available pets, submit adoption applications, and track application status. Need an intuitive, mobile-friendly interface with detailed pet information.
1.3 Key Features
List the main features and functionalities of your application.
•	User Authentication & Authorization: Secure login system with role-based access control (Admin/Adopter) using Laravel Sanctum token-based authentication
•	Shelter Management: Complete CRUD operations for managing multiple animal shelters with location tracking, staff information, and contact details
•	Pet Inventory Management: Comprehensive pet profiles including species, breed, age, gender, weight, health status, food preferences, photos, and adoption status tracking (Available/Reserved/Adopted)
•	Adopter Profile Management: Detailed adopter registration with personal information, occupation, alternate contacts, document uploads (valid ID, home photos)
•	Adoption Request Processing: Full adoption workflow including application submission, status tracking (Pending/Approved/Rejected), interview scheduling, and meet-and-greet coordination
•	Veterinary Records Management: Complete medical history tracking for each pet including visit dates, diagnosis, treatments, and next visit scheduling
•	RESTful API Architecture: 10 distinct API modules with comprehensive endpoints for all system operations
•	Advanced Filtering & Search: Query pets by adoption status, shelter, species, and other criteria
•	Real-time Data Updates: Dynamic data synchronization between frontend and backend using Next.js and Laravel

4.4 Database Normalization
The database follows normalization up to 3NF:

1NF: All tables have primary keys, atomic values, single data types per column
2NF: Satisfies 1NF, all non-key attributes fully depend on primary key
3NF: Satisfies 2NF, no transitive dependencies (e.g., shelter info separated from pets, adopter info separated from requests)

Benefits: Data integrity via foreign keys, reduced redundancy, easier updates, consistency, efficient storage

________________________________________
6. Security & Error Handling
6.1 Security Measures Implemented
•	Authentication: Laravel Sanctum token-based auth, tokens stored securely in database
•	Authorization: Role-based access control via CheckUserType middleware, admin-only route protection
•	Input Validation: Server-side validation on all endpoints, 422 status for invalid input
•	Data Protection: Bcrypt password hashing (cost factor 12), no plain text storage
•	Vulnerability Protection: SQL injection (Eloquent ORM), XSS (SanitizeInput middleware), CSRF protection, mass assignment protection, CORS configuration
6.2 Error Handling
API responses use consistent JSON format with proper HTTP status codes:
- 400 Bad Request, 401 Unauthorized, 403 Forbidden, 404 Not Found, 422 Validation Error, 500 Server Error

Validation error example:
{"message": "Invalid data", "errors": {"email": ["Email already exists"]}}

Database errors handled with try-catch blocks. Frontend displays user-friendly messages via toast notifications. All errors logged to storage/logs/laravel.log with stack traces.

9.2 Code Standards
Describe the coding standards and best practices followed.

•	Naming conventions: 
  - PHP/Laravel: PascalCase for classes (AdminController, Pet), camelCase for methods and variables ($petName, getUserById()), snake_case for database columns (admin_id, shelter_name)
  - JavaScript/TypeScript: camelCase for variables and functions (petData, handleSubmit()), PascalCase for React components (PetCard, Navigation)
  - Files: PascalCase for class files (AdminController.php), kebab-case for frontend component files (pet-card.tsx)

•	Code style: 
  - PHP: PSR-12 coding standard followed with 4-space indentation
  - TypeScript/JavaScript: ESLint configuration enforces consistent style with 2-space indentation
  - No trailing whitespace, consistent line endings (LF)
  - Opening braces on same line for methods, on new line for classes
  - Maximum line length of 120 characters for readability

•	Comments & documentation: 
  - PHPDoc blocks for all classes and public methods describing parameters and return types
  - Inline comments explain complex business logic and algorithms
  - README.md provides project overview and quick start guide
  - API_DOCUMENTATION.md contains comprehensive endpoint documentation
  - PROJECT_STRUCTURE_EXPLANATION.md explains directory organization
  - Database migrations are self-documenting with descriptive column names and constraints

•	Version control: 
  - Git workflow with feature branches for new development
  - Main/master branch contains stable production-ready code
  - Meaningful commit messages following conventional commits format (feat:, fix:, docs:)
  - .gitignore configured to exclude node_modules/, vendor/, .env, and build artifacts
  - Regular commits with atomic changes for easier code review

•	Code organization principles:
  - Single Responsibility Principle: Each class has one clear purpose
  - DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself): Reusable components and utility functions
  - Separation of Concerns: Business logic in models, HTTP handling in controllers, presentation in views/components
  - Eloquent relationships defined in models for clean database queries
  - Middleware for cross-cutting concerns like authentication and input sanitization
9.3 API Endpoints (if applicable)
